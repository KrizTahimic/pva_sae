# Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Created Phase-Based Structure**
- Organized code into three phases matching thesis methodology
- `phase1_dataset_building/` - Dataset generation and classification
- `phase2_sae_analysis/` - SAE analysis (placeholders for implementation)
- `phase3_validation/` - Statistical, robustness, and steering validation

### 2. **Eliminated Code Duplication**
- Extracted common utilities to `interp/common/`
- Removed duplicate files (`dp_v2.py`, original `data_processing.py`)
- Consolidated all shared functions into dedicated modules

### 3. **Improved Organization**
- Created `interp/orchestration/` for pipeline coordination
- Added `scripts/` directory for entry points
- Consolidated data directories into `interp/data/`

### 4. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Separated concerns into focused modules
- Clear import hierarchy
- Consistent naming conventions

## New File Structure

```
pva_sae/
├── common/                    # Shared utilities
├── phase1_dataset_building/   # Dataset generation
├── phase2_sae_analysis/       # SAE analysis (TBD)
├── phase3_validation/         # Validation methods
├── orchestration/             # Pipeline coordination
├── data/                      # All data outputs
│   ├── datasets/             # Generated datasets
│   └── logs/                 # Execution logs
└── scripts/                   # Entry point scripts
    ├── run_full_pipeline.py   # Main entry point
    ├── run_phase1.py         # Phase 1 only
    └── run_production_build.py # Production build
```

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Duplication**: All common code extracted to shared modules
2. **Clear Phase Separation**: Each phase has its own directory
3. **Better Imports**: Clean import paths without circular dependencies
4. **Production Ready**: Maintained all hardening features in organized structure
5. **Easier Testing**: Each phase can be run independently

## Migration Notes

### Import Changes
- `from interp.data_processing import X` → `from phase1_dataset_building import X`
- `from interp.data_processing_hardened import Y` → `from phase1_dataset_building import Y`
- Common utilities now in `from common import Z`

### Data Locations
- Logs: `mbpp_logs/` → `data/logs/`
- Datasets: `mbpp_datasets/` → `data/datasets/`

### Running Code
- Old: `python3 interp/data_processing.py`
- New: `python3 scripts/run_phase1.py` or `python3 scripts/run_full_pipeline.py`

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 2 (SAE Analysis) modules
2. Implement Phase 3 (Validation) modules
3. Complete the pipeline orchestration
4. Add configuration file support
5. Create tests for each phase
