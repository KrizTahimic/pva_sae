PHASE 5.9: WEIGHT ORTHOGONALIZATION TRIANGULATION ANALYSIS
============================================================

Generated: 2025-09-25T01:55:52.289983
Significance Level: 0.05

TRIANGULATION APPROACH
----------------------------------------
This analysis compares three conditions:
1. Baseline: No weight orthogonalization (original model)
2. Zero-Discrimination: Orthogonalization with random non-discriminative features
3. PVA: Orthogonalization with discriminative PVA features

Three pairwise comparisons validate:
- Baseline vs PVA: Does orthogonalization work?
- PVA vs Control: Is effect feature-specific?

CORRECTION EXPERIMENTS (Incorrect→Correct)
----------------------------------------
Baseline Rate: 0.00%
Control Rate: 5.51%
PVA Rate: 2.21%

Statistical Tests:
  Baseline→PVA: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)
  PVA vs Control: p=9.98e-01 (not significant)

Interpretation: PVA orthogonalization corrects errors (2.2% improvement, p=0.00e+00) | PVA and control correction rates similar

CORRUPTION EXPERIMENTS (Correct→Incorrect)
----------------------------------------
Baseline Rate: 0.00%
Control Rate: 18.97%
PVA Rate: 83.62%

Statistical Tests:
  Baseline→PVA: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)
  PVA vs Control: p=5.13e-51 (SIGNIFICANT)

Interpretation: Incorrect-preferring features significantly corrupt (83.6% corruption, p=0.00e+00) | PVA corrupts MORE than control (83.6% vs 19.0%, p=5.13e-51)

OVERALL VALIDATION
----------------------------------------
Validation Strength: MODERATE

Validity Checks:
  orthogonalization_works: ✓ PASS
  correction_specific: ✗ FAIL
  corruption_not_specific: ✗ FAIL

KEY FINDING
----------------------------------------
Comparison of orthogonalization effects:
  Correction: Control 5.5% vs PVA 2.2%
  Corruption: Control 19.0% vs PVA 83.6%

PVA orthogonalization causes MUCH higher corruption (83.6%) than control (19.0%),
suggesting that targeted modifications to discriminative features have stronger
disruptive effects on model behavior than random feature modifications.

CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
Mixed validation: Weight orthogonalization shows effects compared to baseline, but the pattern of specificity is inconsistent. This suggests weight modifications work but may have complex interactions with different feature types.
