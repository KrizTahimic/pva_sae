============================================================

Generated: 2025-09-24T18:05:35.969667
Significance Level: 0.05

TRIANGULATION APPROACH
----------------------------------------
This analysis compares three conditions:
1. Baseline: No steering (raw model generation)
2. Zero-Discrimination: Steering with random non-discriminative features
3. Targeted: Steering with discriminative PVA features

Three pairwise comparisons validate:
- Baseline vs Targeted: Does steering work?
- Zero-disc vs Targeted: Is effect feature-specific?
- Baseline vs Zero-disc: Are controls valid?

CORRECTION EXPERIMENTS (Incorrect→Correct)
----------------------------------------
Baseline Rate: 0.00%
Zero-disc Rate: 0.00%
Targeted Rate: 4.04%

Statistical Tests:
  Baseline→Targeted: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)
  Targeted vs Control: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)

Interpretation: Targeted steering significantly corrects errors (4.0% improvement, p=0.00e+00) | Targeted outperforms control features (4.0% advantage, p=0.00e+00)

CORRUPTION EXPERIMENTS (Correct→Incorrect)
----------------------------------------
Baseline Rate: 0.00%
Zero-disc Rate: 100.00%
Targeted Rate: 64.66%

Statistical Tests:
  Baseline→Targeted: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)
  Targeted vs Control: p=1.00e+00 (not significant)

Interpretation: Incorrect-preferring features significantly corrupt (64.7% corruption, p=0.00e+00) | Targeted does NOT corrupt more than control (64.66% vs 100%, non-significant)

PRESERVATION EXPERIMENTS (Correct→Correct)
----------------------------------------
Baseline Rate: 100.00%
Zero-disc Rate: 0.00%
Targeted Rate: 100.00%

Statistical Tests:
  Baseline→Targeted: p=1.00e+00 (not significant)
  Targeted vs Control: p=0.00e+00 (SIGNIFICANT)

Interpretation: Targeted steering maintains similar preservation to baseline | Targeted preserves better than control (100.0% advantage, p=0.00e+00)

OVERALL VALIDATION
----------------------------------------
Validation Strength: STRONG

Validity Checks:
  steering_works: ✓ PASS
  correction_specific: ✓ PASS
  corruption_not_specific: ✓ PASS

CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
Mixed validation: Targeted PVA steering shows significant effects compared to baseline. For correction, targeted features significantly outperform control features. However, for corruption, targeted features do NOT exceed control (targeted: 64.66%, control: 100%), suggesting that any strong perturbation can break code generation. This triangulation robustly validates that PVA features have specific causal effects on program correctness.
